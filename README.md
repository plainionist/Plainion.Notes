Plainion.Notes repository contains several attempts to use the "power of plain text" 
(pragmatic programmers) to "manage content" - say notes, links and small articles.


The repository contains

- a light-weight wiki engine
- a light-weight HTTP server hosting the wiki engine to provide a pragmatic personal wiki
- a WPF application embedding Chrome brower, the Wiki engine and the Http server in an "all-in-one" solution
- a WPF sticky notes app in wiki style

None of these solutions is in daily practical use :( because it is not simple enough. Switching from edit
mode to rendering mode all the time doesnt give a great user experience.

A simple, markup sensible and auto-completion-able rich text editor would probably more beneficial.
(e.g. like in MS Outlook)
